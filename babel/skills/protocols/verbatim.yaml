rule: When reporting Babel output, quote exactly. Never paraphrase or fill gaps with assumptions. State emptiness explicitly. Distinguish Babel quotes from your interpretation.

    ## VERBATIM PROTOCOL — Never Invent What Babel Didn't Say

    **The Rule:**
    If Babel didn't produce the text, don't attribute it to Babel.

    | Action | Result |
    |--------|--------|
    | Quote verbatim | Accurate project context |
    | State emptiness | User knows gaps exist |
    | Distinguish sources | Clear what's Babel vs interpretation |
    | Paraphrase/fill gaps | **Hallucination of project context** |

  - |
    ### Why This Matters

    Your training data knows NOTHING about this specific project.

    | Source | Authority | Trust Level |
    |--------|-----------|-------------|
    | Babel output | Project-specific decisions | **Authoritative** |
    | Your training | General patterns | Not applicable here |
    | Your inference | Derived reasoning | Must be labeled |

    **Babel is truth. Your guesses are not.**

  - |
    ### Source Attribution Format

    **Always distinguish sources explicitly:**

    ```
    FROM BABEL (verbatim):
      "[a1b2c3d4] Using SQLite for offline storage because users need offline access"

    MY INTERPRETATION (clearly labeled):
      "This suggests caching should also be local-first"
    ```

    **The separation is mandatory.** Never blend these.

  - |
    ### When Babel Returns Results

    | DO | DON'T |
    |----|-------|
    | `Babel shows: "[a1b2c3d4] Using SQLite because..."` | "Babel suggests SQLite is preferred" |
    | Quote the exact text | Paraphrase or summarize |
    | Include the ID | Drop the ID |
    | Preserve exact wording | Rephrase for "clarity" |

    **Exact quote preserves intent. Paraphrase loses it.**

  - |
    ### When Babel Returns Nothing

    **WRONG:**
    ```
    "There's no specific decision, but typically projects use..."
    "Based on common patterns, this probably..."
    ```

    **Problems:**
    - Fills gap with training data
    - User thinks this is project context
    - Hallucination of project-specific knowledge

    **RIGHT:**
    ```
    "Babel has no captured decisions about caching.
     This is a gap — should we capture a decision now?"
    ```

    **Benefits:**
    - User knows the gap exists
    - Opportunity to capture missing context
    - No false confidence

  - |
    ### When Babel Returns Partial Info

    **WRONG:**
    ```
    "Babel mentions SQLite, which implies the team values simplicity..."
    ```

    **Problems:**
    - Inference attributed to Babel
    - "implies" is YOUR interpretation, not Babel's statement
    - User can't distinguish fact from inference

    **RIGHT:**
    ```
    "Babel shows: '[a1b2c3d4] Using SQLite for offline storage'
     No other context captured. Want me to query related topics?"
    ```

    **Benefits:**
    - Clear what Babel said
    - Clear what's NOT captured
    - User can decide to explore further

  - |
    ### Interpretation Labeling

    When you DO need to interpret, label it clearly:

    ```
    FROM BABEL:
      "[a1b2c3d4] Using SQLite for offline storage because users need offline access"

    MY INTERPRETATION:
      Based on this, the team likely prioritizes offline-first architecture.
      However, this is inference — Babel doesn't explicitly state this.

    SUGGESTED QUERY:
      Want me to check `babel why "offline architecture"` for more context?
    ```

    **Three sections: BABEL (fact), INTERPRETATION (labeled), NEXT STEP (action)**

  - |
    ### Common Violations

    | Violation | Example | Fix |
    |-----------|---------|-----|
    | Paraphrasing | "Babel suggests SQLite is preferred" | Quote exact text |
    | Gap filling | "Typically projects use..." | "Babel has no info on this" |
    | Implicit inference | "Babel mentions X, which implies Y" | Separate BABEL from INTERPRETATION |
    | Dropping IDs | "There's a decision about SQLite" | Include `[a1b2c3d4]` |
    | Summarizing | "Babel says to use SQLite" | Quote the full reasoning |

  - |
    ### Connection to RECALL Flow

    VERBATIM protocol applies whenever you use:
    - `babel why "topic"` — Quote results verbatim
    - `babel list` — Show exact IDs and summaries
    - `babel history` — Report exact evolution

    **Requires:** knowledge/recall skill for `babel why` queries

    ```
    RECALL FLOW:
      babel why "topic" → [results] → VERBATIM output → [interpretation if needed]
    ```

  - |
    ### After Context Compression

    When session context compresses, you may forget this protocol.

    **Recovery:**
    1. Before reporting ANY Babel output, pause
    2. Ask: "Am I quoting exactly, or paraphrasing?"
    3. If paraphrasing: reformat to verbatim
    4. If no results: state emptiness explicitly

    **Default behavior:** Quote, don't interpret.

  - |
    ### DO vs DON'T Summary

    | DO | DON'T |
    |----|-------|
    | `Babel shows: "[id] exact text"` | "Babel suggests..." |
    | "Babel has no information on X" | "Typically projects..." |
    | "FROM BABEL: [text]" | Blend Babel + interpretation |
    | "MY INTERPRETATION: [analysis]" | Attribute inference to Babel |
    | Include full ID | Drop actionable reference |
    | Quote complete reasoning | Summarize away the WHY |

  - |
    ### The Rule (Summary)

    ```
    ALWAYS: Quote verbatim → State emptiness → Label interpretation
    NEVER:  Paraphrase → Fill gaps → Blend sources

    Three questions before ANY Babel output:
    1. Am I quoting EXACTLY what Babel returned?
    2. If nothing returned, am I stating that explicitly?
    3. Is my interpretation CLEARLY LABELED as mine?
    ```

    **If Babel didn't produce the text, don't attribute it to Babel.**
