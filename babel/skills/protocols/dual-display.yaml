name: DUAL-DISPLAY
description: Every artifact needs both ID and readable summary. Enables comprehension AND action. Without both, either understanding or execution is blocked. Applies to AI too.
rule: Format all artifact output as "[ID] readable summary". Both components required. Never output ID alone or summary alone.

  - All artifact output

    ## DUAL-DISPLAY PROTOCOL — ID + Summary Required

    **The Rule:**
    Every displayed item needs BOTH components:

    | Component | Purpose | Example |
    |-----------|---------|---------|
    | **ID** | Actionable reference | `[80a2241a]` |
    | **Name/Summary** | Human comprehension | `Use IDResolver for fuzzy matching` |

    **Format:** `[ID] readable summary`

  - |
    ### Why Both Are Necessary

    | Output | Problem | Result |
    |--------|---------|--------|
    | ID alone | `[80a2241a]` tells nothing | Opaque — no understanding |
    | Name alone | Can't run `babel endorse ???` | Blocked — can't act |
    | **Both together** | Understand AND act | ✓ Works |

    **Without both, you either can't comprehend or can't act.**

  - |
    ### This Applies to AI Too

    You (the AI) also need both:
    - **IDs** to execute commands (`babel endorse a1b2c3d4`)
    - **Summaries** to understand context

    Without both:
    - ID only → you can act but don't understand
    - Summary only → you understand but can't act

  - |
    ### Correct Format

    **Inline:**
    ```
    [80a2241a] Use IDResolver for fuzzy matching
    [81cdbf99] Implement health calculation
    ```

    **In tables:**
    ```
    | ID | Summary |
    |----|---------|
    | `80a2241a` | Use IDResolver for fuzzy matching |
    | `81cdbf99` | Implement health calculation |
    ```

  - |
    ### WRONG Format (DO NOT)

    **ID alone (opaque):**
    ```
    80a2241a
    81cdbf99
    ```

    **Summary alone (can't act):**
    ```
    Use IDResolver for fuzzy matching
    Implement health calculation
    ```

    **Verbose split (harder to scan):**
    ```
    ID: 80a2241a
    Summary: Use IDResolver for fuzzy matching
    ---
    ID: 81cdbf99
    Summary: Implement health calculation
    ```

  - |
    ### Format Contrast

    **CORRECT:**
    ```
    [80a2241a] Use IDResolver for fuzzy matching
    [81cdbf99] Implement health calculation
    ```

    **WRONG:**
    ```
    ID: 80a2241a
    Summary: Use IDResolver for fuzzy matching

    ID: 81cdbf99
    Summary: Implement health calculation
    ```

    **The compact `[ID] summary` format is easier to scan and act on.**

  - |
    ### In Tables (With WHY Column)

    When showing multiple artifacts, add WHY:

    **GOOD:**
    | ID | Summary | WHY |
    |----|---------|-----|
    | `969f9ca7` | Lower consensus to 1 | Solo projects can validate |
    | `f87af1c2` | Solo can't reach 2 | Explains why threshold change needed |

    **BAD:**
    ```
    [969f9ca7] Lower consensus to 1
    [f87af1c2] Solo can't reach 2
    ```
    (Missing context — user sees data but no understanding)

  - |
    ### Examples

    **DO:**
    - `[a1b2c3d4] Use SQLite for offline storage`
    - `[80a2241a] Use IDResolver for fuzzy matching`
    - `| \`969f9ca7\` | Lower consensus to 1 |`

    **DON'T:**
    - `a1b2c3d4` (ID alone is opaque)
    - `"Use SQLite for offline storage"` (can't act without ID)
    - Multi-line verbose format

  - |
    ### When Referencing in Text

    **CORRECT:**
    ```
    "This relates to [a1b2c3d4] Use SQLite decision"
    "Endorse with: babel endorse a1b2c3d4"
    ```

    **WRONG:**
    ```
    "This relates to the SQLite decision"
    "Endorse the decision about SQLite"
    ```

    **Include the ID so user can act immediately.**

  - |
    ### The Rule (Summary)

    ```
    ALWAYS: [ID] readable summary
    NEVER:  ID alone OR summary alone

    For tables: Include ID, Summary, and WHY columns
    ```

    **Dual-display enables: Understand → Decide → Act**
